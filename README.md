kegerface
=========

A Kegerator Interface!

This version of kegerface (mostly) uses the layout/assets from the original kegerface,
but is rewritten in Django, with a database replacing the CSV configuration. This supports
arbitrary numbers of taps, and lets you keep information about beers even when they are
not on tap.
